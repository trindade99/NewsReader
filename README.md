## Setup Instructions

Before running this app, you’ll need to provide your own **`NEWS_API_KEY`** in the `local.properties` file.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do **not** commit your API key to the repository. Exposing API keys publicly is a security risk.

### 1. Get an API Key

You can obtain a free API key from the official News API website:
[https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)

### 2. Add it to `local.properties`

In your project’s root directory, open (or create) the `local.properties` file and add:

```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Run the App

Once your key is in place, you’re ready to build and run the app as usual.
